# SOAT - Simple Online Accountability Token

Accountability is a funny thing... It is hard to gain and keep but very easy to lose. 

What's worse is that there are not enought checks and balances in place to ensure that people do not abuse the trust and freedom they have been granted.

All too oftern do we see trolls and rude people online, abusing the anonymity of the internet and hiding behind their screens like cowards in the dark.

I am looking for a means of holding people accountable for their actions or at least making it so that wrong doers cannot get away with their a crimes.

This is an idea I have been toying with in my head for a while... just trying to see if actually commiting it (no pun intended) to paper will actually do anything.
